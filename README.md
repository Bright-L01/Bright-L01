# Bright Liu

AI/ML Software Engineering Intern at AWS | Harvard BA/MA Mathematics, CS & Statistics

## Current Work

Building MCP-compatible analytics infrastructure at AWS that processes 300k+ metrics daily, leveraging Bedrock LLMs for real-time diagnostics. Reduced query latency by 40% for systems handling 10k+ requests/week.

**Research & Technical Focus:**
- Enterprise-scale ML infrastructure (AWS EC2/S3/Lambda)
- Medical AI research with Vision Transformers (MGH/HMS)
- Statistical modeling and stochastic processes
- High-performance data processing and algorithmic optimization

## Notable Projects
