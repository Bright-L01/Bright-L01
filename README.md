# Bright Liu

AI/ML Engineer focused on production systems and emerging technologies.

## Current Work

I build AI tooling infrastructure and work on large-scale ML systems. Currently exploring Model Context Protocol servers and formal verification optimization.

**Technical Focus:**
- Production ML systems with performance requirements
- AI tool integration and MCP ecosystem development  
- Formal verification and evidence-based optimization
- Large-scale data processing and inference optimization

## Notable Projects

**[music21-mcp-server](https://github.com/Bright-L01/music21-mcp-server)**  
Production-ready MCP server for music analysis. Features OAuth2 authentication, rate limiting, circuit breakers, and comprehensive monitoring. First production-ready music21 MCP integration.

**[simpulse](https://github.com/Bright-L01/simpulse)**  
Evidence-based Lean 4 simp optimization using real diagnostic data from Lean 4.8.0+. Includes performance validation with measurable improvements and confidence scoring for recommendations.

**[music-gen-ai](https://github.com/Bright-L01/music-gen-ai)**  
Text-to-music generation system with transformer architectures. Supports multi-instrument generation, real-time streaming, and ONNX optimization for production inference.

**[drw-crypto-prediction](https://github.com/Bright-L01/drw-crypto-prediction)**  
Industry-grade crypto market prediction system. Processes 600M+ rows with sub-30s inference requirements using LightGBM ensemble methods and high-performance computing with Polars/DuckDB.

**[networkx-mcp-server](https://github.com/Bright-L01/networkx-mcp-server)**  
First NetworkX integration for Model Context Protocol. Enables graph analysis directly in AI conversations with enterprise security features.
